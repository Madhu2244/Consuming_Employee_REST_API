# Consuming_Employee_REST_API
I am using the API code from another project to practice API calls. 

The Employee-REST-API was not written by me, I used the code from https://github.com/Madhu2244/springboot-angular-mongodb-crud-tutorial created by RameshMF so that I can understand how API is built using MongoDB and Tomcat. I made many edits to their API so that I can understand how it works, so it is not completely identical to RameshMF code.

On the other hand, I wrote most of the code for Consuming-Employee-REST-API. I had to use many online resources to understand how to call the API from a separate program (which I had learned in earlier repositories). PostMan was helpful in teaching me how to make an exact API call since it generates the API call code if you give it a URL.
